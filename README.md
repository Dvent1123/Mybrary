# Mybrary

This is the first full stack project I went through and is based on a tutorial made by WebDevSimplified. It uses mongodb, express, node, and then ejs as the templating language. It lets you you do all the CRUD functions (create,read, update, and delete) on a library database. The database is a mongodb database and lets you perform the functions on real data. It serves all the files through ejs but has no users or permissions.

## Usage
To use the app clone the repo then cd into the project folder. Use npm install or yarn install to install all the dependencies. The project is using nodemon for hot reload so you can just use npm start to start nodemon and the server through the start script. You will need to create a mongodb account as well as a .env file.  The project is listening on port 3000 so just your localhost to see the project.
